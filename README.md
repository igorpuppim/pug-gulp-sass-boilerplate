# pug-gulp-sass-boilerplate
Boilerplate for easy landing page development


## Hello fellow developer!
Tired of building complex structures for quick projects? 
I GOTCHU, clone this beauty, hit ``npm install`` and run ``gulp`` on your favourite terminal.

Pug, Compressed JS, Sass builder, the whole gang is here.

I will probably add some folders on the pug directory and sass, but hey, at least it works on gulp 4!
